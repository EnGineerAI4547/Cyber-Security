# Cybersecurity Work and Study

This repository is for my cybersecurity studies and practice, including exercises and projects related to various cyber security roles, such as pentester, SOC analyst, incident response, threat analysis, secure DevOps, and automation. I will be using Python, C, C++, and Rust for implementations and work, as well as Linux knowledge, database knowledge, and cloud computing experience with Azure and AWS.

## Daily Code Commits

I will commit code whenever possible to keep track of my progress in my cybersecurity studies.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into subdirectories based on different cyber security roles and topics. The structure of the repository is as follows:

## Study Topics

In my studies, I will be covering a range of topics, including:

- Cryptographic primitives, protocols, and networks
- Asymmetric cryptography
- Symmetric cryptography
- Hash functions
- Key exchanges
- Digital signatures
- Other schemes

## References

I will be using the following references in my studies:

## Certifications

I am currently studying for my CompTIA Security+ and Network+ certifications, which I plan to obtain by the end of the summer of 2023. My goal is to pursue a career in security engineering, starting with a focus on purple hat and white box techniques.
